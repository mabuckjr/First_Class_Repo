# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
   -This project involved helping a ficticious friend named Louise analyze Kickstarters of various types. The same set of data was used both in our activities courses, as well as our challenge assignment. I used different tools in Excel, from pivot tables and charts, statistical analysis formulas, formulas designed to clean up the data, and more to help me "make sense" of the data provided. All in all, I learned new skills and refined others through this example project. Louise should know **a lot** more about her data now! 
### Purpose
    -The purpose of this project *for me* is to ensure we know the basics behind each tool in excel. With this challenge now completed, I know that I can take the skills I learned here into my job and perform a more in-depth analysis of any dataset that is given to me from here on. I not only learned individual skills that will help me along my "excel journey," but I also learned how to combine these skills to sift down to a smaller amount of data that I truly want to analyze.
    -For Louise, the purpose of the project was to understand many different aspects of Kickstarters. Sometimes, she wanted data about a specific type of Kickstarter (such as those related to Theater). Sometimes she wanted to know more about the data based on other paramaters, such as the geographic location of the kickstarter, the date it was created, or the fundraising goal. *Sometimes, it was all three!* She wanted to truly understand what made a kickstarter work, and I think my analysis will help her in her journey.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
